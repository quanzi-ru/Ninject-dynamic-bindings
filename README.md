# Ninject dynamic bindings
This is tests and PoC of possibility of making dynamic bindings for Ninject. This idea goes from question on StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36658762/creating-a-custom-ninject-provider-for-multiple-types-implementing-the-same-inte.
Idea is to dynamically add multiple custom binding instead of one special set in initialization.
